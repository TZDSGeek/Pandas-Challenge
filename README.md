# Pandas-Challenge

For the most part, I was able to complete this assignment by utilizing the course content that was learned in this module. There were several instances where I needed to utilize the Pandas documentation, Stack Overflow, and ASKBCS for trouble shooting. I only glanced at previous examples of this assignment in order to double check my aggregate functions and ensure the code was producing the desired output.
